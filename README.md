# Titanic-Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting survival of passengers who travelled on Titanic Ship.

## Probelm Discription
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, 
resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others,and here we are supposed to predict 
the number of people survived using the dataset

### Project Description
This project analyses which people were likely to survive. In this particular project, tools of machine learning have been used to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
In this project Data cleaning and feature engineering is been used. I have used most of the  ML algorithms (Logistic regression, k-means, svc, Kneighbours,GaussianNB,Random forest,Perceptron,SGD classifier,Decision tree classifier etc.)
and I observed that random forest classifier and decision tree works better than any other algorithm for this problem.
